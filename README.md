# GAN-AE_LHCOlympics
Code used for the LHC Olympics 2020 challenge

### To use the code

The code requires python>=3.6 to run.

First, install all the dependencies (I recommend doing that in a new virtual environement) :
```bash
pip install requirement.txt
```
To train the model :
```bash
python train.py
```

To apply the trained model and the bump hunting algorithm :
```bash
python apply.py
```
